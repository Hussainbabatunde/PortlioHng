# Create a Mobile Application with Personal Details
This project is a mobile application that displays my Slack identity, Slack profile picture, allowing you to put a face to the name and fostering a more personal connection.

But that's not all! What sets this app apart is its convenient "Open GitHub" button. With just a tap, you can access my GitHub profile directly within the app, thanks to a WebView component that seamlessly redirects you. This feature ensures you can effortlessly explore my projects, contributions, and repositories without leaving the application, streamlining the process of getting to know me and my work.

Stay connected, explore my GitHub, and discover more about me through this all-in-one mobile app.
